        Materials: 30 counters: 15 of one color and 15 of another color <br>

            <li>Each player starts with 15 counters of their color. Each counter represents one soldier. </li>
            <li>At the start of each round, each player secretly chooses how many soldiers to deploy.</li>
            <li>Once each player has decided, both players will shout, "3, 2, 1, deploy!" and place their deployed
                soldiers at the center of the play area. </li>
            <li>The player who deployed more soldiers takes all armies in the center of the play area.</li>
            <li>These armies are placed in the player's side pile. They cannot be redeployed.</li>
            <li>If both players deployed the same number of soldiers, each player puts only their own soldiers into
                their side pile. </li>
            <li>After that, the next round starts.</li>
            <li>Once one player runs out of soldiers to deploy, the game ends.</li>
            <li>Each undeployed soldier at the end of the game kills an enemy soldier. The opponent does
                not get any points from the dead soldiers.</li>
            <li>The player who controls more soldiers (side pile + undeployed soldiers) wins the game.</li>
            <li>In the case of a tie, play again.</li>
        </ul> <br>
